## AsyncImage
When you create an instance of AsyncImage, SwiftUI provides you with phase data, which updates you on the   state of image loading. For example, phase.error provides you with errors that occur, while phase.image provides an image, if available. You can use the phase data to show the appropriate UI based on the phase state.
